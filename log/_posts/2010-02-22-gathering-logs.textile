*Gathering Logs:* I keep my notes in dated folders like this 

<pre>2010/02/_log.txt</pre> 

It is a temporal style system where things can slowly fade into history but are still searchable and readily retrievable.  When I want to browse through my log notes I just run this.

<pre>find . -name \_log.txt | xargs cat | less</pre>

Find is recursive by default.  The xargs tips the stack of filenames on its side for the cat command. And less gives me vim-like navigability.  Couple this with an alias and I've got an easy way to go back in time.
