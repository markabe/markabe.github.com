*Lightweight Desktop for Ubuntu Server:* When trying to incorporate Linux into an environment dominated by Windows it helps to do what you can to smooth the transition.  One way to do this is to give the even the server a desktop environment.  

Now you most likely don't want the full workstation desktop since it has tons of unnecessary programs for a server like OpenOffice. Here are some packages that give you a basic desktop environment with some useful tools.  

This is a single command but I've broke it across multiple lines for readability.

<pre>
  sudo apt-get install 
  compiz-gnome 
  firefox 
  gdm 
  gnome-core 
  gnome-media 
  gnome-system-monitor 
  gnome-system-tools 
  gnome-volume-manager 
  gnome-utils 
  gnome-app-install 
  gnome-applets 
  synaptic 
  sysv-rc-conf
  ubuntu-artwork 
  xorg 
</pre>
