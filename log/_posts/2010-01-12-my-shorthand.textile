title: How I write notes.
---

I have my own home grown way of taking notes. My goal is to use the same formatting for handwritten notes and text files.  I've tried plenty of tools like wikis and Things on the Mac but its hard to beat plain text.

I've created some highlighting for this in Vim. Here is what it looks like.

Here is the text version.

<pre>
++ shorthand

*section*
-item
-Done: completed item
?question
?favor option1 over option2
  +favors option1
  $favors option2
-[person] [askPerson] [date or time] [ file.txt ]
# Comment.
-xxx xxx xxx #End of line comment.
*Bookmark
$unfavorable
$ command-line
  code
<subsection>
// Documentation.
/**
